## Data Governance Experience


<topic id="data_governance_overview">
### Healthcare Interoperability Fundamentals


**Definition**: Data governance in healthcare ensures patient data is collected, stored, transmitted, and utilized according to consistent standards and policies, maintaining data quality and privacy.


**Industry Challenge**: Healthcare organizations face complexities in navigating legacy systems, evolving standards, and diverse workflows while transitioning from HL7 Version 2 messaging to FHIR-based ecosystems.


**Standards Comparison**:
- **HL7 V2**: Foundational standard used by 90% of U.S. hospitals but with significant implementation variability
- **FHIR**: Modern, resource-centric model using RESTful APIs, standardized data definitions, and robust extensibility support


**Integration Challenges**:
- Z-segment customizations in HL7 V2
- Data normalization issues
- Versioning complexity
- Regulatory compliance requirements


**Current State Assessment**: Despite adoption of FHIR R4 guided by US Core Implementation Guide and aligned with United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), semantic inconsistencies and local customizations continue to create significant variability across providers, EHR vendors, and data repositories.
</topic>


<topic id="governance_challenges">
### Data Governance Challenges in FHIR Systems


**Semantic Variations Despite Uniform Profiles**:
- **Local Code Systems**: Organizations often embed internal codes for labs, medications, and procedures that don't map cleanly to standard terminologies like LOINC, RxNorm, CPT, or SNOMED CT
- **Extensions vs. Overloaded Fields**: Organizations may overextend standard fields to carry proprietary data or redefine existing extensions
- **Partial Adoption**: Some sites implement only mandatory fields while others populate recommended or optional fields


**Workflow Discrepancies**:
- **Administrative Data Conventions**: Different handling of encounter reasons, location data, and other administrative information
- **Timestamp Variations**: Inconsistent practices for status updates and timezone handling


**Real-World Example**:
- **Hospital X**: Returns Hemoglobin A1c with standard LOINC code 55454-3, fully populated valueQuantity and referenceRange
- **Hospital Y**: Uses local code HA1CST for the same test with non-standard unit representation
- **Impact**: Population health analysis querying for LOINC code "55454-3" will miss relevant data from Hospital Y without robust code-mapping
</topic>


<topic id="code_vs_semantic">
### Code Normalization vs. Semantic Normalization


**Key Differences**:


| Aspect | Code Normalization | Semantic Normalization |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Focus | Mapping terminologies to standard code systems | Ensuring consistent meaning of coded data |
| Example Challenge | Legacy lab code ↔ LOINC equivalence | Unit conversion (e.g., % vs. mmol/mol for HbA1c) |
| Impact | Data discovery and aggregation | Clinical interpretation and decision-making |


**Code Normalization Challenges**:
- Local EHR or LIS codes differing from standard LOINC codes
- Drugs recorded in text form or brand-specific identifiers rather than RxNorm
- Problem list codes varying between ICD-10, SNOMED CT, or local synonyms


**Semantic Normalization Challenges**:
- Interpretation vs. Actual Value: Inconsistent labeling of results as "normal" or "abnormal"
- Timing Discrepancies: Some systems use specimen collection date, others use result finalization date
- Multi-Component Observations: Variation in how complex data is bundled or separated
- Field Usage: Placement of context in comments or custom extensions rather than dedicated fields


**Impact on Quality Measurement**:
- CQL engines expecting numeric valueQuantity might misunderstand or skip readings stored as text
- Methodological differences (fasting vs. non-fasting, venous vs. capillary blood) affect clinical validity
- Inconsistent specimen type documentation can lead to invalid comparisons
</topic>


<topic id="solutions">
### Practical Strategies for Data Governance


**Code Normalization Solutions**:
- **Terminology Management**: Maintain robust terminology services and concept mapping between local and standard codes
- **Automated Validation**: Implement code validation checks to flag unrecognized codes for intervention
- **Mapping at Ingestion**: Transform local codes to standard terminologies during the data ingestion process


**Semantic Normalization Solutions**:
- **Consistent Data Elements**: Standardize usage of fields like Observation.valueQuantity, keeping interpretations separate
- **Profile-Based Validation**: Create and enforce organization-specific FHIR profiles requiring proper data formatting
- **Documented Conventions**: Establish clear guidelines for how borderline results, flags, and comments should be recorded
- **Flexible CQL Authoring**: Design measure logic to handle alternative fields or formats while transitioning to standards


**Continuous Improvement Approach**:
1. **Align with Standard Code Systems**: Enforce data mapping against terminology servers
2. **Implement Profile-Level Rules**: Extend FHIR profiles with specific requirements for key data elements
3. **Automate Validation**: Check both code use and semantic conformance at multiple stages
4. **Monitor Quality Metrics**: Track recognized vs. unrecognized codes, completeness, and validity
5. **Collaborate with Clinical Teams**: Involve clinicians in defining standardized documentation practices


**Governance Benefits**:
- Improved CDS outputs aligned with clinical guidelines
- More accurate quality measure calculation
- Enhanced care gap identification
- Reduced costs associated with chronic care through preventative interventions
